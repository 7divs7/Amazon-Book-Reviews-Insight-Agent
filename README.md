# üìï Amazon Book Review Insight Agent

An LLM-powered, agentic system that enables natural language exploration of Amazon book reviews. Built with **LangGraph**, **Claude** and **Databricks AI/BI Genie**, it allows users to ask flexible questions and get structured, sentiment-rich insights from large-scale book review data.

üì¶ Dataset: [Amazon US Customer Reviews Dataset - Books (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cynthiarempel/amazon-us-customer-reviews-dataset?select=amazon_reviews_us_Books_v1_02.tsv)

## üîç Example Queries

- "What do readers dislike about 'The Secret'?"
- "Summarize the sentiment around 'Atomic Habits' in terms of practicality and readability."
- "What themes do people frequently mention in reviews of 'The Alchemist'?"
- "Which self-help books have received the most helpful votes?"

## üï∏Ô∏è Workflow
- Planner: Parses user intent, generates task prompts
- AI/ BI Genie: Filters reviews from a Delta Table in Unity Catalog
- Analyzer: Uses Claude to extract sentiment, keywords, and summaries

## üöÄ How to Run
Set up and test the Amazon Review Insight Agent on Databricks in just a few steps:

1. Create a Genie Space in Databricks

  [Set up Genie Spaces](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/genie/set-up) Refer to this documentation to set up a Genie Space in Databricks for your Amazon Book review dataset. 
  
2. Upload the Notebook

  Upload the provided ```.ipynb``` notebook to your Databricks workspace.

3. Configure Environment Variables (Databricks)

  Create a scope and add your secrets:
  ```bash
  databricks secrets create-scope --scope my-secrets
  ```
  ```bash
  databricks secrets put --scope my-secrets --key DATABRICKS_HOST
  databricks secrets put --scope my-secrets --key DATABRICKS_PAT_TOKEN
  databricks secrets put --scope my-secrets --key GENIE_SPACE_ID
  ```

  Access them in your notebook:
  ```bash
  import os

  DATABRICKS_HOST = dbutils.secrets.get(scope="my-secrets", key="DATABRICKS_HOST")
  DATABRICKS_PAT_TOKEN = dbutils.secrets.get(scope="my-secrets", key="DATABRICKS_PAT_TOKEN")
  GENIE_SPACE_ID = dbutils.secrets.get(scope="my-secrets", key="GENIE_SPACE_ID")
```

4. Test the Agent

  Interact with the agent to test the output. Replace the placeholder input example with your specific questions.
  ```bash
  AGENT.predict({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are customers saying about the Kindle's battery life?"}]})
  ```

## üí¨ Want to Turn This Into a Chat App?
This project can be easily extended into a chat-based web application using tools like Streamlit or Gradio. By wrapping the LangGraph chain in a backend function, users can ask natural language questions and receive real-time insights from Amazon product reviews. The agent can also be deployed as a model serving endpoint in Databricks, with a custom UI (e.g., Streamlit) as the frontend. This makes it well-suited for building interactive product feedback assistants or customer experience dashboards.
